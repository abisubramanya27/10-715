\title{10-715 Fall 2022 Homeworks}

\begin{document}

\begin{center}
{\Large CMU 10-715: Homework 2}\\
Soft Support Vector Machine Theory and Implementation \\
{\bf Released: Sept. 14, 2022}.\\
{\bf Due: Sept. 23, 2022, 11:59 PM}.\\
\end{center}


\textbf{\large Instructions}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Collaboration policy:} Collaboration on solving the homework is allowed, after you have thought about the problems on your own. It is also OK to get clarification (but not solutions) from books, again after you have thought about the problems on your own. Please don’t search for answers on the web, previous years’ homeworks, etc. (please ask the TAs if you are not sure if you can use a particular reference). There are two requirements: first, cite your collaborators fully and completely (e.g., ``Alice explained to me what is asked in Question 4.3''). Second, write your solution \emph{independently}: close the book and all of your notes, and send collaborators out of the room, so that the solution comes from you only. 
    
    \item \textbf{Submitting your work:} On Gradescope:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Submit your completed python file, soft\_svm.py, to the assignment titled ``HW2 (code) Soft Support Vector Machine Theory and Implementation".
        \item Submit your PDF report file, named [your andrew id].pdf , to the assignment titled ``HW2 (report) Soft Support Vector Machine Theory and Implementation". Upon submission, please follow Gradescope instructions to match the question numbers with the page numbers of your report. 
    \end{itemize}
    There is no limit on the number of submissions to Gradescope. 
    
    \item \textbf{Gradescope access:} The link to this course is \url{https://www.gradescope.com/courses/428731/}. You should already have access (from HW1).
    
    \item \textbf{Auto-grader:} Your code will be evaluated with Gradescope auto-grader. We encourage you to start early and use the auto-grader to check that your implementation is correct.
    
    \item \textbf{Late days:} For each homework you get three late days to be used only when anything urgent comes up. No points will be deducted for using these late days. We will consider an honor system where we will rely on you to use the late days appropriately.
    
    \item \textbf{Skeleton code:} The python files, \textcolor{blue}{data.py} and \textcolor{blue}{soft\_svm.py}, can be found at the attachment section of the Diderot post that announces the release of this homework.
\end{itemize}
